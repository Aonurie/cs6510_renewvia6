As a rural electrical engineer, I want to upload GPS coordinates for buildings and my power source, 
specify pole & cable cost parameters, so that I can automatically generate and visualize an optimized, 
cost‑effective distribution network that meets my cost, voltage‑drop, and distance constraints. I am able to do this 
by going to the project tab and hitting uploading a file with my buildings and power source coordinates as well as 
my parameters. After uploading I receive my optimal pole locations and conenctions and a cost of the project.
