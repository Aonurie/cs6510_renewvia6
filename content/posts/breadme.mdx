## P6 Renewvia-Design

### Overview
The Renewvia Energy project aims to develop an electricity‐grid design optimizer using an optimization algorithm. Our project helps optimize pole and cable placement (and overall cost) to deliver energy in a region in Kenya. 
Deliverables include:
- A graph‐based optimization algorithm  
- A research paper documenting our approach  
- An interactive website for exploring project info and running the optimizer  

### Features
- **Project Dashboard**  
  - Timeline  
  - Team members & roles  
  - Goals & updates  
  - Presentation slides & demo  
  - Final presentation video  
  - Lighthouse performance scores  
- **Grid Optimizer**  
  - Upload a CSV of candidate pole sites & demand points  
  - Run the algorithm in‐browser 
  - Download/export the resulting optimized grid layout  

### Built With
- **Frontend:** Next.js – React framework for server‑side rendering and static site generation
- **Backend:** Python 
- **Machine Learning & Graph Algorithms:** scikit‑learn, NetworkX, scipy 
- **Other:** pandas, NumPy, flask,matplotlib, gunicorn, openpyxl, flask-cors

## Graph-based Power Network Optimization

This folder contains code for creating and optimizing power distribution networks using graph-based approaches. The code implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for network optimization and includes utilities for network creation and visualization.

### Code Structure

- `network_dag.py`: Core implementation of the power network as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
  - Defines node types (power source, transformer, pole, building)
  - Implements network topology and connection logic
  - Handles network state management and cost calculations

- `GCN.py`: Graph Convolutional Network implementation
  - Implements a 3-layer GCN for network optimization
  - Handles network state transformations and action proposals
  - Includes visualization utilities

- `create_network.py`: Network creation and initialization utilities
  - Implements pole placement algorithms
  - Handles network topology creation
  - Includes visualization functions

- `test_data_generator.py`: Utilities for generating test data and scenarios

### Dependencies

To run the code in this folder, you'll need to install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install torch torch-geometric numpy matplotlib pandas pulp scikit-learn
```

### Code Flow

Code is run from `create_network.py` 
- User may choose to generate test data or read in test data (csv)
    - both options are included in the main function; uncomment/comment lines accordingly
- The network is initialized using `NetworkDAG` class from `network_dag.py`
- The GCN model from `GCN.py` is used to optimize the network topology
- Results are visualized using the plotting utilities provided in each module
