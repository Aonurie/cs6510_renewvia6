The goal of our team is to come up with a viable solution to the graph theory problem proposed by Nicholas Selby at Renewvia. More specifically, we hope to create a model for automating electricity grid pole and cable distribution such that the results include an optimal, cost-saving design for a given community. Further, we plan to start the project by focusing on its parameterization aspects as recommended by Nicholas. We will shift focus to optimization only when we feel like weâ€™ve first been able to propose a worthwhile solution to finding all the possible grid designs given the basic constraints.
