## Team Members and Roles

### Taylor Boyd
- Will gather a clear list of parameters, constraints, and optimization considerations from Nicholas (i.e. cable lengths & costs, voltage drop, etc.).
- Will research related works and propose methods to the team regarding initial parameterization and approach to determining pole count and locations (i.e. clustering, etc.).
- Will write the Abstract and Introduction for the team’s research paper.

### Enming Li
- Will research related works and propose methods to the team regarding ways to input geographical data into a model (satellite/map images, Coordinate ref sys (CRS), graph with mapped building/obstacle points?).
- Will write the Conclusion section for the team’s research paper.

### Taylor Nguyen
- Will research related works and propose methods to the team regarding initial parameterization and approach to determining pole count and locations (i.e. clustering, etc.).
- Will help write the Methods section for the team’s research paper.

### Dharshan Rammohan
- Will create our Overleaf project for the team’s academic paper.
- Will research related works & propose methods to the team regarding ways to find all possible grid designs (connectivity) within given constraints (no loops, cable lengths, voltage drop, etc.), assuming initial pole count and locations have already been determined.
- Will help write the Methods section for the team’s research paper.

> **Note:** We’ll all work on the related works section of the team’s research paper since we will all be doing our own research. We will also all work on the optimization piece later when the time comes.
